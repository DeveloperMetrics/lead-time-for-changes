# lead-time-for-changes
A GitHub Action to roughly calculate DORA lead time for changes This is not meant to be an exhaustive calculation, but we are able to approximate fairly close for most  of workflows. Why? Our [insights](https://samlearnsazure.blog/2022/08/23/my-insights-about-measuring-dora-devops-metrics-and-how-you-can-learn-from-my-mistakes/) indicated that many applications don't need exhaustive DORA analysis - a high level, order of magnitude result is accurate for most workloads.
